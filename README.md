# 2048-in-Codeskulptor
This is my recreation of the game 2048 for a project in a coursera class. The logic for the game was created by me, but the GUI and everything in it was created by professors at Rice University.

To use this game go to https://py3.codeskulptor.org/ and plug the code in. 

If you have any edits or questions, please feel free to post an issue or a pull request.

Please don't copy my code for use in a coursera project. Its not ethical.

I do not own or claim to own any rights to coursera, codeskulptor, or 2048.

Have fun!
